pa_ppx Version 0.09
-------------------

* [03 Aug 2021] update pa_ppx to support camlp5 8.00.03 (and OCaml 4.14.0)

pa_ppx Version 0.08
-------------------

* [03 Aug 2021] update pa_ppx to support camlp5 8.00.02 (and OCaml 4.13.0)

pa_ppx Version 0.07
-------------------

* [23 Dec 2020] update pa_ppx.import with better type-rewriting.
  Now we can write

  [%%import: Stuff.zz
    [@with [%typ: int * bool] := [%typ: bool * int]]
  ]

  with the meaning that "int * bool" is rewritten to "bool * int" in
  the r.h.s. of types imported from Stuff.zz.

* [27 Oct 2020] updated to compat with camlp5 8.00~alpha07.  Not
  compatible with previous versions (b/c significant changes to
  Camlp5's AST).

  added `pa_ppx.deriving_plugins.params` providing support for
  demarshaling from OCaml expressions into data-types, hence for
  automating demarshaling of options for PPX rewriters.

pa_ppx Version 0.04
-------------------

* [30 Sep 2020] change pa_ppx.import so that it doesn't automatically
  rename types when importing recursive types.  E.g. in

  type longident = [%import: Longident.t]

  it will not rename instances of "t" in the imported definition to
  "longident".  To recover this behaviour, just change the above to

  type longident = [%import: Longident.t
    [@with t := longident]
  ]

  This allows much greater flexibility in using pa_ppx.import to
  manipulate collections of recursive types.

pa_ppx Version 0.03
-------------------

* [28 Sep 2020] conditionalized opam on "os != macos" until we find
  somebody who can help us test builds on macos.

* [27 Sep 2020] added TRIP-TEST-ALL to generate and save
  generated-files (and run tests) for all supported ocaml versions.

* [24 Sep 2020] new way of selecting generated-src versions.
  hopefully this will make pa_ppx immune to "new camlp5 release, we
  can't build" problems.

  pa_ppx.import now support "mli-only" and "redeclare" options:

  "-pa_import-mli-only": to ensure that only MLI files are consulting during import
  (e.g. to pull in OCaml AST from an older OCaml version, and avoid
  doing so from the stdlib)

  "-pa_import-redeclare": to import types and *not* add the type-equation that
  binds them to the existing type.  For instance, to combine with
  mli-only (since there isn't any existing type that matches).

  cache files as they're read in pa_import, so we don't need to reread them.

  the [%%import ...] item-extension (for str-items and sig-items) now takes a
  [@add ...] attribute, viz.

  [%%import: MLast.expr
    [@add type loc = [%import: MLast.loc]
          and type_var = [%import: MLast.type_var]
          and 'a vala = [%import: 'a Ploc.vala]
    ]
  ]

  This says to import the entire typedecl-group in which MLast.expr is
  declared, and to add to that the types MLast.type_var and Ploc.vala,
  all in a single grouped typedef (which will be recursive, if the
  initial typedef is).  The "@add" attribute payload is a str-item, so
  it can itself have a payload that is an item-extension ("[%%import
  ...]") in order to import-and-add entire typedecl groups, thus:

  [%%import: MLast.expr
    [@add [%%import: MLast.loc]]
    [@add [%%import: MLast.type_var]]
    [@add [%%import: 'a Ploc.vala]]
    [@with Ploc.vala := vala]
  ] [@@deriving show]

  The "@with" directive applies to all types imported.  If we wanted
  to apply it to one of the types in "@add" directives (say, for
  "MLast.type_var"), we'd just put it in that "%%import" attribute in
  the normal way.

* [12 Sep 2020] added a bunch of support for matching & substitution over types,
  to support pa_ppx_migrate (which is now in a separate project).

  also add generated files for camlp5 8.00~alpha04

* [22 Aug 2020] cleanup opam file, bump version for compat with camlp5 8.00~alpha03.

  Change versioning process.

pa_ppx Version 0.02
-------------------

* [16 Aug 2020] update build process to save pp_MLast.ml[i] generated
  files in dirs named by camlp5 version.  update to sync with camlp5
  8.00~alpha02.

* [01 Aug 2020] fixed bugs in handling of attributes of type-derivers.
  Now, it should be the case that if two type-derivers declare that
  they use the same attribute-names (e.g. "name", "nobuiltin") and in
  any compilation unit (e.g. file) they both use such an attribute
  (even if not in the same type-declaration), then attribute-names
  MUST be qualified with the deriver-name (e.g. "yojson.name",
  "sexp.name").  This guarantees that there can be no confusion about
  which attributes refer to which derivers.

* [30 Jul 2020] (minor) update generated pretty-printers (add newlines between items).

pa_ppx Version 0.01
-------------------

* [30 Jul 2020] first released version
